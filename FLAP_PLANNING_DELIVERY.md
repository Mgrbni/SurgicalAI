# SurgicalAI Flap Planning System - Delivery Summary

## 🏥 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive source-backed facial flap planning system for SurgicalAI that transforms clinical inputs `(diagnosis, site, lesion diameter)` into evidence-based surgical recommendations including incision lines, candidate flaps, rotation/advancement vectors, anatomy cautions, and contraindication gates.

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Structured Knowledge Base ✅
**File**: `surgicalai_demo/knowledge/facial_flaps.yaml`

- **RSTL/Langer's Lines**: 16 anatomic units with orientation degrees and scar-hiding folds
- **Flap Options**: 7 evidence-based flaps with design parameters, vascular anatomy, and danger warnings
- **Oncologic Margins**: Melanoma, BCC, and SCC margin requirements with risk stratification
- **Anatomic Danger Zones**: Facial nerve branches, vascular structures, and lacrimal system
- **Source Citations**: 23 anchored literature references from NCBI, NCCN, PMC, etc.

### 2. Rules Engine ✅
**File**: `surgicalai_demo/rules/flap_planner.py`

**Core Function**: `plan_flap(diagnosis, site, diameter_mm, borders_well_defined, high_risk) → Plan`

**Logic Flow**:
1. **Oncologic Gates**: Defer melanoma for staging; high-risk BCC/SCC → prefer Mohs
2. **RSTL Alignment**: Site-specific orientation (nasal tip 45°, eyelid 0°, forehead 90°)
3. **Flap Selection**: Size/site matching (nasal tip ≤15mm → bilobed; >25mm → forehead flap)
4. **Danger Assessment**: Anatomic warnings (alar retraction, ectropion, facial nerve)

**Output Structure**:
```json
{
  "incision_orientation_deg": 45,
  "rstl_unit": "nasal_tip", 
  "oncology": {"action": "Standard excision", "margins_mm": 4},
  "candidates": [{"flap": "bilobed_zitelli", "fit": "excellent", "vector": {...}}],
  "danger": ["alar retraction", "facial nerve temporal branch"],
  "citations": ["Bilobed flap for nasal reconstruction (2020)", "..."],
  "defer": false
}
```

### 3. Pipeline Integration ✅
**File**: `surgicalai_demo/pipeline.py`

- Integrated into existing `run_demo()` workflow
- Extracts top diagnosis from probabilities
- Maps estimated diameter and anatomic site
- Saves detailed plan as `plan.json` in output directory
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy planning

### 4. Visual Overlays ✅
**File**: `surgicalai_demo/features.py`

Enhanced `save_overlay()` function adds:
- **RSTL Lines**: Gold orientation lines through lesion center
- **Flap Design Hints**: 
  - Bilobed: Two-lobe geometry with angles
  - Rotation: Curved advancement vectors
  - Advancement: Direction arrows with Burow triangles
  - Forehead: Pedicle visualization
- **Legend**: Color-coded overlay explanation

### 5. Comprehensive Testing ✅
**Files**: `tests/test_flap_planner.py`, `tests/test_flap_integration.py`

**Test Coverage**:
- Oncologic gate decisions (melanoma defer, BCC/SCC risk stratification)
- Flap selection by site and size
- RSTL orientation accuracy
- JSON serialization
- Pipeline integration
- Error handling

**Verification Scripts**:
- `verify_flap_system.py`: Basic functionality tests
- `demo_flap_integration.py`: Pipeline integration demo
- `complete_demo.py`: Full system verification

### 6. Documentation ✅
**File**: `docs/flap_rules.md`

Comprehensive clinical reference including:
- Oncologic margin tables by diagnosis and risk level
- RSTL orientation by anatomic unit
- Flap selection matrix (site × size → recommendations)
- Anatomic danger zones with safe surgical planes
- Planning algorithm workflow
- Usage examples with code snippets
- Complete citation list with URLs

## 🎯 Clinical Scenarios Tested

| Scenario | Input | Expected Output | Result |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **Small BCC - Nasal Tip** | BCC, 8mm, well-defined | Bilobed flap, proceed | ✅ Correct |
| **Melanoma - Any Site** | Melanoma, 12mm | Defer for staging | ✅ Correct |
| **High-Risk BCC** | BCC, H-zone, ill-defined | Defer for Mohs | ✅ Correct |
| **Large Cheek Defect** | SCC, 25mm | Cervicofacial flap | ✅ Suggested |

## 📊 Evidence-Based Features

### Oncologic Safety Gates
- **Melanoma**: Always defer for staging and margin control
- **BCC Low-Risk**: 4mm margins, proceed with reconstruction
- **BCC High-Risk**: ≥5mm margins, prefer Mohs in H-zone
- **SCC**: Risk-stratified approach based on size and differentiation

### RSTL-Aligned Planning
- **Nasal Tip**: 45° oblique alignment with alar-columellar angles
- **Eyelids**: 0° horizontal parallel to lid margins
- **Forehead**: 90° vertical with frontalis muscle fibers
- **Cheek**: 30° oblique toward preauricular region

### Flap Selection Hierarchy
- **Nasal Reconstruction**: Bilobed → Dorsal nasal → Paramedian forehead
- **Eyelid Reconstruction**: Primary closure → Tenzel → Mustardé
- **Cheek Reconstruction**: V-Y advancement → Rotation → Cervicofacial

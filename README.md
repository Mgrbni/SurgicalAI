# SurgicalAI

**Research Prototype â€“ Not for Clinical Use**

Minimal pipeline demonstrating analysis, planning and visualization for reconstructive surgery.

## One Command Demo

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

surgicalai demo --out outputs/demo
```

To include an OpenAI generated narrative, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and run:

```bash
surgicalai demo --out outputs/demo --with-llm --model gpt-4o
```

Outputs are written to the specified folder and include meshes, JSON files, images and a PDF report.

## API and UI

Start the API:

```bash
python -m surgicalai.api
```

Launch the Gradio UI:

```bash
python -m surgicalai.ui
```

## LLM Usage

Only de-identified numeric summaries are sent to the OpenAI API. Meshes and images never leave the machine.

## Development

```bash
pytest -q
```

USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are assisting a plastic surgery decision support demo.

Context:
- Lesion site: {{ site }}
- Extracted cues: {{ cues_json }}
- Contraindication flags: {{ flags_json }}

Task:
1) Produce ranking of likely diagnoses (e.g., melanoma, BCC, SCC, seborrheic keratosis, dermatofibroma, actinic keratosis).
2) Provide a primary_dx string.
3) If resection is indicated and safe, propose a single flap suggestion aligned to RSTL for the site.
4) Include 0â€“N contraindications and warnings.
5) Include citations array (short guideline refs).

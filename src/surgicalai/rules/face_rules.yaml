        source_ids: ["NCCN_MEL","AAD_MEL","NBK572149"]

      "1.01–2mm": 
        peripheral_cm: "1–2"
        deep: "to but not incl. fascia"

        source_ids: ["NCCN_MEL"]
        rationale: "For suspected melanoma without histology, use conservative 1-2cm margins"
        defect_calculation: "Add 2-4cm to lesion diameter, err on larger side"
    reconstruction_policy:
      defer_if:
        - condition: "H‑zone location"
          rationale: "tissue‑sparing/permangan margins, frequent need for staged clearance"

          rationale: "oncology priority over cosmesis"
        - condition: "breslow_depth unknown"
          rationale: "cannot determine appropriate margins without histology"

        deep: "to fat"
        source_ids: ["AAD_Nevus","Dermatology_Guidelines"]
        rationale: "Dysplastic nevi require wider margins due to potential for incomplete excision"
        defect_calculation: "Add 6-10mm to lesion diameter"
    reconstruction_policy:
      defer_if: ["high-grade dysplasia without clear margins"]

      typical:
        peripheral_mm: "1-2"
        deep: "to dermis/fat"
        source_ids: ["Dermatology_Guidelines"]
        rationale: "Seborrheic keratoses are benign and require minimal margins"
        defect_calculation: "Add 2-4mm to lesion diameter"
    reconstruction_policy:
      defer_if: []
      proceed_if: "typical appearance; consider shave/curettage for smaller lesions"

    length: "lesion_diameter + 2 * margin + accommodation_factor"
    width: "lesion_width + 2 * margin"

special_considerations:
  facial_subunit_principles:
    rule: "Consider excising entire subunit if defect >50% of subunit"
    rationale: "Better aesthetic outcome than partial subunit reconstruction"
    applicable_units: ["nasal_tip", "alar", "lip_subunits"]
  
  cosmetic_units:
    nasal_tip: "Consider tip-defining points and supratip break"
    alar: "Preserve alar rim and nostril symmetry"
    lip: "Maintain vermillion border and cupid's bow"
